# Introduction

The economic crisis in Sri Lanka has had an impact on various fields, including tourism, 
agriculture, and manufacturing. Under this project, we are implementing a solution for the 
impact of the agriculture field.
In the agricultural field, there are some problems that still continue through the decades. 
Among them, product shortage and not paying the true value for products are major problems. 
For those problems, We are planning to implement this mobile application to overcome this 
matter.
“Agro” is a mobile application that will be developed to provide a solution for the current 
economic crisis in Sri Lanka. Through this application, we are planning to build a platform for 
farmers and buyers to sell and buy their products based on the true prices that farmers belong to. 
Farmers can sell products and request buyers' posts. Buyers can add posts and request farmers’ 
posts.
Apart from that, there are vehicle renters and Agri experts. The vehicle renters rent the 
vehicle to buyers and farmers to transport their products. The Agri experts share agricultural 
knowledge with buyers and farmers to reduce the knowledge gap
